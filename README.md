# How to run
## Prerequisites
It is important that the following tools have been downloaded for this project:
- Node:
To prove that node is installed on the system run the following command
```
node --version
```
it is recommended to have also installed nvm. 
You can find the step by step how to download Node it in the following link: https://github.com/nodejs/node

## How to run
1. Clone this repository
2. Type this command in order to install npm on the current folder. 
```
npm install
```
You will notice that every package that the app uses are going to be installed in this step.

3. Type this command in order to start npm
```

4. To be able to deploy it locally use the following URL: http: // localhost: 3000
5. Because we are also using MongoDB we will need to run the following command

And, later
```

You will see that mongo will run and that you will have access to every collection and insert data on your local DB.
